C Utility Programs
Hey! i'm Yash
This repo includes a includes small C programs I wrote to solve everyday problems using simple logic. They cover things like:

Calculating GPA

Estimating fuel costs

Converting currency

Figuring out Zakat and income tax

Checking load shedding schedules

And a few more handy tools

Each file is a solo-working program, great for beginners learning how to use if-else, loops, functions, and basic math in C.

Feel free to explore or use them as practice examples.
